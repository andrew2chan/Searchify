### Biggest takeaways
- TailwindCSS is a mobile first css framework and is meant to be built mobile first (Will keep this in mind for future projects)
- Getting familiar with the Spotify API and different authorization flows
- Getting familiar with d3.js and the usage of selectors, data driven graphics, joins, etc.
- Used a few things I didn't before useRef (persisting state between rerenders as well as keeping references on an element) and useCallback (caching functions unless the dependency changes)
